# Mediapipe-Projects-Computer-Vision
This repository contains some projects which I made using MediaPipe in Python

## Concept:
Based on the landmarks detected by the computer vision models of Mediapipe library, bounding box coordinates can be found. This methodology is followed to track and monitor the regions of human body as required.
